                <dd>
                    She is the most loving mother and played out perfectly to the story in where she truly loves Ted. Everything that Ted was looking for was always so close, but he never saw Tracy before their official meeting. She truly loves Ted and was amazing to him.

                <dt>Why we hate her:</dt>
                <dd>
                    Waited 8 seasons to finally see her, and she was killed off the show in less than a season.
